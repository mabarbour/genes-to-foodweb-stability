# Output

The folder contains processed data files. `.RData` files were used to efficiently reproduce results presented in the main text and Supplementary Material. Descriptions are given below:

## `critical-transitions.RData`

Contains a saved version of data and analyses of critical transitions in food-web structure. This file is derived from `critical-transitions.Rmd`.

## `structural-stability.RData`

Contains a saved version of data and analyses of the Bayesian multivariate autoregressive model and proximity to critical boundaries. This file is derived from `structural-stability.Rmd`. This file was too large to use version control on GitHub; therefore, I used the [piggyback package](https://docs.ropensci.org/piggyback/articles/intro.html) to attach it to v1.0 (see Assets in Release v1.0 `output.2fstructural-stability.RData`)


## `full.mv.norm.brm.rds` and `reduced.#.brm.rds`

Contains saved versions of each model analyzed in `structural-stability.Rmd`. I saved each version because it considerably sped up generating `structural-stability.html`.

## `plant-growth-no-insects.RData`

Contains data and analysis of plant growth in the absence of insects.

## `timeseries_df.csv`

Organized data generated by `code/prep-time-series.R` for Bayesian multivariate autoregressive models and structural stability analysis.
