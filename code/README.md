# Code

## `plot-feasibility-domain.R`

Contains code for calculating normalized angles from critical boundaries, as well as plotting feasibility domains (as in Fig. 4 of the paper).

## `simulate-community-dynamics.R`

This code is used for the non-equilibrium simulations presented in the Supplementary Material.

## `summarize_stability_metrics.R`

This code calculates credible intervals of *AOP2*$-$ on species' intrinsic growth rates and structural stability.
