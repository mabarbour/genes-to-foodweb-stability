### **Abstract**: Genes encode information that determine an organism's fitness. Yet, we know little about the extent to which genes of one species determine the persistence of interacting species in an ecological community. Here we tested the effect of three plant defense genes on the persistence of an insect food web and found that a single allele at a single gene promoted coexistence by increasing plant growth, which in turn increased the intrinsic growth rates of species across multiple trophic levels. Our discovery of a keystone gene illustrates the need to bridge between biological scales, from genes to ecosystems, to understand community persistence. 

### **One-sentence summary**: A single gene controls the diversity of species in an experimental food web.
